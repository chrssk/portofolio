        <p>This is website that my friends and I created in submission to a competition called “Kompetisi Pembelajaran
             Daring”. The team consists 5 people, in this team we have coders, designer, and content creator.  
             I acted as the team leader and coder for this project. The website itself is a site that offer courses 
             that you can take online and get a certificate/credit once you have finished. Our ideas were to have 
             resourceful materials that people can get access to. Our biggest emphasis when creating this website is 
             in your learning experience you will also need other people support. That is why our websites is designed 
             with a community feature, where you can interact with other learners. Thus, the name “Community of Learners”, 
             because to have a successful learning experience you will need a community support. 
             The websites also have other feature called connect, where you can connect with courses instructor in their 
             office hour and  ask them question about the courses. This project earned 3rd Place in the competition.</p>

        <h3>Production Data Tracking Web Application</h3>
        <img src="project2.jpg" class=" mx-auto d-block w-75 mt-5 mb-5" alt="Project 2">
        <p>
            This is a project that I do in my internship for a company called MYCL. The company is a start-up 
            based on Bandung that manufactured vegan leather made from mushroom. In this project, I’m given the 
            responsibilities to analyze the current production process and create a web application to manage and 
            track all of the production data.  With this project I help the company to digitize the production data. 
            Most of the coding work in this project I did it alone, but I also have a little help from my supervisor. 
            For this project I used agile method for the application development. The application is mostly written 
            in PHP and I used MySQL for the database.
